# Vercel Deployment Instructions

## Environment Variables Required

Add these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select your backend project: `cardiology-website-backend`

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Go to: **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**

Add these variables:

```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://pmi_it:Loai-66343439@cluster0.e0rjr.mongodb.net/cardiology_hospital?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET = your-super-secret-jwt-key-for-cardiology-hospital-2024

```

### 3. Redeploy
After adding environment variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic redeploy

## Testing the Deployment
